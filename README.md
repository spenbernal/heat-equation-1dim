# Heat Equation in One Dimension

## Purpose
The Heat Equation is a partial differential equation given by 

$u_t = -ku_{xx}$

with initial and boundary conditions, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant.

The equation can be solved numerically by finite difference method. This project will look to explore solving the heat equation with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions by finite difference method and visualizing the solution.
