# Heat Equation in One Dimension

## Purpose
The Heat Equation is a partial differential equation given by 

$u_t = -ku_{xx}$

with initial and boundary conditions.

The equation can be solved numerically by finite difference method, and the goal of this project is to solve and visualize the heat equation with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions.
